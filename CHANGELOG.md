# CHANGELOG

All significant changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

## v0.3.0 (2026-01-31)

### Breaking Changes

* `Exn::from_iter` has been renamed to `Exn::raise_all`
* `exn::Error` trait bound has been removed in favor of inlined `StdError + Send + Sync + 'static` bounds.
* `err.raise()` has been moved to the `exn::ErrorExt` extension trait.
* `Exn::error(&self)` has been replaced with `impl Deref<Target = E> for Exn<E>`.

### New Features

* `Exn<E>` now implements `Deref<Target = E>`, allowing for more ergonomic access to the inner error.
* This crate is now `no_std` compatible, while the `alloc` crate is still required for heap allocations. It is worth noting that `no_std` support is a nice-to-have feature, and can be dropped if it blocks other important features in the future. Before 1.0, once `exn` APIs settle down, the decision on whether to keep `no_std` as a promise will be finalized.
* `Frame` now implements `std::error::Error`.
* Support convert `Exn<E>` into `Box<dyn std::error::Error>`.
